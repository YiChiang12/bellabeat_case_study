Welcome to my Bellabeat Data Analysis Case Study! This project demonstrates my ability to perform structured data preparation, analysis, visualization and deliver actionable insights aligned with real-world business objectives.

Bellabeat is a high-tech wellness company creating innovative health-focused products tailored specifically for women. In this case study, I leverage publicly available fitness data to explore consumer usage trends and apply these insights to Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## Background
Bellabeat is a high-tech wellness company focused on health-tracking devices for women. Founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, the company seeks to leverage smart device data to improve its marketing strategies and product offerings. Their products include wellness trackers such as Leaf, wellness watches like Time, and hydration-tracking water bottles like Spring.

## Objectives
- **Objective 1**: Identify trends in smart device usage.
- **Objective 2**: Understand how these trends relate to Bellabeat’s current customer base.
- **Objective 3**: Develop actionable recommendations to enhance Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## Problem
Bellabeat wants to understand how consumers utilize non-Bellabeat smart wellness devices to identify market trends, enhance their product strategy, and improve customer engagement. The company seeks insights into user behaviors and preferences that can inform targeted marketing campaigns and boost product adoption.
