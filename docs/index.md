## Background
Bellabeat is a high-tech wellness company focused on health-tracking devices for women. Founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, the company seeks to leverage smart device data to improve its marketing strategies and product offerings. Their products include wellness trackers such as Leaf, wellness watches like Time, and hydration-tracking water bottles like Spring.

## Objectives
- **Objective 1**: Identify trends in smart device usage.
- **Objective 2**: Understand how these trends relate to Bellabeat’s current customer base.
- **Objective 3**: Develop actionable recommendations to enhance Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## Problem
Bellabeat wants to understand how consumers utilize non-Bellabeat smart wellness devices to identify market trends, enhance their product strategy, and improve customer engagement. The company seeks insights into user behaviors and preferences that can inform targeted marketing campaigns and boost product adoption.
