# Step 1: ASK

The first step of the data analysis process is clearly defining the business task and understanding stakeholder needs to ensure the analysis effectively addresses business goals.

---

## Business Task

Bellabeat is a wellness technology company specializing in products that help women track their health and wellness. The company aims to analyze consumer usage patterns from smart device data to unlock new marketing opportunities. 

The specific business task I address in this project is:

> **"Analyze Fitbit smart device data to identify trends in user behavior, particularly focusing on physical activity, sleep, and stress management. Apply these insights to provide strategic recommendations for improving the marketing and positioning of Bellabeat‚Äôs Leaf wellness tracker."**

The Leaf wellness tracker is specifically chosen due to its alignment with available Fitbit data (activity, sleep, stress), allowing for practical insights.

## Key Stakeholders
Clearly identifying stakeholders ensures that the recommendations are relevant and impactful.

| Stakeholder | Role & Relevance |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Ur≈°ka Sr≈°en** | Co-founder & Chief Creative Officer at Bellabeat; Interested in growth opportunities through data-driven insights. |
| **Sando Mur** | Co-founder & Executive; Interested in strategic implications for business expansion and profitability. |
| **Bellabeat Marketing Analytics Team** | Team responsible for executing data-informed marketing strategies. |
| **Bellabeat Executive Leadership** | Decision-makers on product development, marketing budgets, and strategic planning. |

## Guiding Questions
These questions guide the entire data analysis process and define the scope of exploration:

1. **What trends exist in consumer smart device usage?**
   - Identify daily habits, common behaviors, and usage frequency among device users.

2. **How do these identified trends apply specifically to Bellabeat customers?**
   - Evaluate similarities and differences between the Fitbit data and known Bellabeat user profiles.

3. **How can these insights directly influence Bellabeat‚Äôs marketing strategy?**
   - Recommend actionable steps based on insights that could improve customer engagement and product adoption.
